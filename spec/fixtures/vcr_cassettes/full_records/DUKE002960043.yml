        (history and law, Wayne State Univ.) presents an engaging history of women
        and American law that synthesizes the social, political, and legal history
        of women from the Colonial period through the 1990s. She addresses the changes
        in women''s legal status as well as continued limits to their equality, while
        providing an original framework for understanding women''s legal history.
        Following the American Revolution, women developed speech communities, such
        as women''s rights conventions, to voice their criticism of oppressive laws
        and social practices. After the Civil War, women formed suffrage communities,
        seeking the ballot in order to enact social reform and gain access to the
        polity. In addition, VanBurkleo posits three main "settlements" in the legal
        status of women, showing how shifting political ideals caused women, the judiciary,
        and the government to reconsider women''s rights as citizens. The book introduces
        readers to the legal history of women, but it should also provoke discussion
        on feminist strategies and the intransigence of American society and the judiciary
        in extending equal protection under the law to women. This ambitious book
        will be a valuable addition to history, law, and women''s studies collections
        at all levels. C. Faulkner SUNY College at Geneseo</a></Fld520></Notes><SSIFlds><Fld997

        to the World surveys the treatment of women in American law from the nation''s
        earliest beginnings in British North America to the present. An original work
        of historical synthesis, the book aims to build bridges between fields long
        thought to be unbridgeable -- among them, thehistory of women, American constitutional
        and legal history, political theory, and law. It delinates the shifting relationships
        between American law practice and women, both within the family and elsewhere,
        as it looks beyond the campagin for women''s suffrage to broader zones of
        contest andcontroversy. Women''s stories and voices are used throughout to
        drive home the extraordinary range and persistence of female rebellion since
        the 1630s -- when Anne Hutchinson and Ann Hibbens decided to oppose forces
        of constraint in colonial New England -- to the present era of "post-feminist"retrenchment
        and backlash. As the narrative documents women''s ongoing battles for such
        rights have been governed differently from men, often out of the state''s
        line of vision, and that much of this difference reflected the survival of
        a unitary monarchical "head" in the constitutional and moraleconomy of households.
        Excellent for use in constitutional law and women''s studies classes.</a></Fld520></Notes><SSIFlds><Fld997
